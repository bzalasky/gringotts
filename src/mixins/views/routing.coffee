   * A utility mixin for a View or a CollectionView. It helps to pass routing
   * parameters down the view hierarchy. Also adds helper methods to get current
   * browser query state (usually it's received from a Collection or a Model
   * with StatefulUrlParams mixin applied) or to redirect browser to current
   * route with updated query state.
   * The routeState is expected to be a StatefulUrlParams or it's proxy
   * with getState() method.
